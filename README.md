# OrcaHello: A real-time AI-assisted killer whale notification system üé± üêã

[Orcasound](https://www.orcasound.net/) has set up a hydrophone network in the Puget Sound. Killer whales sometimes swim by these hydrophones and vocalize in the form of calls.

We trained a deep learning model to find these calls in hydrophone audio. Each overlapping 2 second sub-segment is classified as whale call/ no-whale call.
Shown below is a 1-minute segment of hydrophone audio visualized as a spectrogram with whale calls detected by the model.

When whale-activity is detected by the model, it sends an email to our Moderators who are killer whale experts.

Once they receive this email, they can visit the [Moderator Portal](https://aifororcas.azurewebsites.net/) shown below to confirm or reject model detections.

Most importantly, they tag detections with information if the whale call was emitted by a Southern Resident Killer Whale (SRKW) - an endangered ecotype found in the Puget Sound. If a SRKW is confirmed, an email is sent to subscribers.

This repository contains the implementations for the following  components that make up OrcaHello.
- [ModeratorFrontEnd](ModeratorFrontEnd) - Frontend code for the [Moderator Portal](https://aifororcas.azurewebsites.net/).
- [NotificationSystem](NotificationSystem) - Code to trigger email notifications.
- [InferenceSystem](InferenceSystem) - Code to perform inference with the trained model.
- [ModelTraining](ModelTraining) - Data preparation and model training.
- [ModelEvaluation](ModelEvaluation) - Benchmarking trained models on test sets.
